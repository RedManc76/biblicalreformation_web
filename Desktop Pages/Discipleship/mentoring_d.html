            <div class="singlepanel">
                
                <h2 class="quote">The Bible does not tell us to make converts, but rather disciples. A Christian's effectiveness is determined by his or her obedience to God's word. Not simply because they act in a correct manner, but by obeying God's word, a Christian walks in closer step with their Lord and in a greater reality and manifestation of his power.</h2>
                
                <h2 class="quote">Christianity differs from the false religions in that it is a supernatural religion in which God works through and in his people to accomplish his own goals and purposes.</h2>
                
                <h2 class="quote">The discipleship life cycle takes a fresh new Christian from their first encounter with God's power in salvation to a wholehearted follower of Jesus Christ. Capable and equipped to disciple the next generation.</h2>
                
            </div>
        
            <button class="singleaccordion">Who?</button>
            <div class="singlepanel">
                
                <h2 class="scripture">'Iron sharpens iron,
                and one man sharpens another' Prov 27:17</h2>
                <h2 class="quote">Discipleship benefits all Christians at any stage of maturity, but it is especially important for those who are young and inexperienced in the faith.</h2>   
                <h2 class="quote">Discipleship takes place primarily in the setting of a local church; hence, the first task of any evangelist is to connect new converts with a local Bible-believing church. Where their souls can be charged to the church eldership, who have been entrusted by the Lord Jesus Christ himself with the responsibility of caring for the members of that church.</h2>     
                <h2 class="quote">The wider church body can and frequently does supplement the local church's discipleship process. A new convert's bond with the person the Lord used to bring them to faith is often unique, and we are always glad to walk alongside and disciple individuals the Lord brings to us.</h2>        
                
            </div>
        
            <button class="singleaccordion">What?</button>
            <div class="singlepanel">
                
                <h2 class="scripture">Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. - Matt 28:19-20</h2>   
                <h2 class="quote">The purpose of discipleship is divided into two main categories. To start with, we must learn what Jesus Christ has instructed us to do. Furthermore, we must obey those commands.</h2>
                <h2 class="quote">As stated previously, Christianity is a supernatural religion. Christian growth is marked by a better recognition of our weaknesses and reliance on God's strength rather than by an increase in our own power and abilities.</h2>
                <h2 class="quote">As a result, the knowledge we must acquire is not a set of laws that we must strive to obey but rather an understanding of our own weakness and, more crucially, an understanding of God's power and might.</h2>
                <h2 class="quote">The Bible, God's Word, is the primary source of this knowledge. Any discipleship that is not regulated, constrained, and supported by God's word is worthless at best and harmful at worst.</h2>
                <h2 class="quote">Once we have determined what God expects of us through his word, we must communicate with God through prayer. There are various reasons to pray to God, but the fundamental purpose is to acknowledge our weakness and his power and willingness to grant all that we require, and to secure those things by asking and believing.</h2>
                <h2 class="quote">Discipleship should consequently include considerable training and instruction in the practise of prayer.</h2>

            <button class="accordion">How?</button>

                <button class="subaccordion">Our Approach</button>
                <div class="subpanel">
                    <h2 class="quote">We can divide our approach to discipleship into three steps. These steps are all part of a lifelong process and thus overlap to varying degrees.</h2>
                    <h2 class="quote">However, they are sequential in this way. That it is highly impractical to execute the subsequent step without a high level of conformity with the prior stage.</h2>
                    <h2 class="quote">Church history is filled with holy men and women who have been used by God in marvellous ways. They came from all backgrounds, with varying resources and abilities, but they all mastered these three steps.</h2>
                    <h2 class="quote">We want to be an instrument that the Lord employs to shape you into his image and prepare you as a holy vessel for a powerful outpouring of his Spirit. Whereby you are made ready to bring great glory to the Lord Jesus Christ and advance his kingdom.</h2>
                </div>
                
                <button class="subaccordion">Way of Discipline</button>
                <div class="subpanel">
                    <h2 class="scripture">And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed. - Mark 1:35</h2>
                    <h2 class="quote">It's no coincidence that the words discipline and disciple share the same root; it's necessary. The first responsibility of a new convert is to organise their lives in such a way that they can better grasp and obey God's word.</h2>
                    <h2 class="quote">Personality determines how quickly a person adjusts to a more organised life. In addition, individual circumstances bring their own set of unique challenges and opportunities.</h2>
                    <h2 class="quote">The disciple must understand the critical importance of discipline. Many Christian lives have been barren simply because the value of disciplined living has been overlooked. Even a cursory examination of church history reveals that any individual who was mightily utilised by the Lord had a disciplined life.</h2>
                    <h2 class="quote">For example, going to bed at the same time every night may not appear to be a source of spiritual power, but the everyday aspects of your Christian walk will have a profound effect on your usefulness.</h2>
                    <h2 class="quote">If Christ descended from heaven to pay the penalty for our sin, we can at the very least get up half an hour earlier to be with him before the day begins.</h2>
                    <h2 class="quote">Those who engaged in our discipleship course learn crucial areas of Christian discipline such as time management, devotional structuring, and prioritisation.</h2>
                    
                </div>
                
                <button class="subaccordion">Way of Sacrifice</button>
                <div class="subpanel">
        
                    <h2 class="scripture">Then Jesus told his disciples, â€œIf anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. - Matt 16:24</h2>
                    <h2 class="quote">Although specifics differ from person to person, the essential patterns are the same when it comes to discipline. Sacrificial living, on the other hand, will appear very different from person to person. It is likewise to be expected that the sacrificial life will intensify over time.</h2>
                    <h2 class="quote">It is often organic. As a Christian grows in faith, they perceive more of the beauty and majesty of Jesus Christ, and as a result, the things of the world below become dull in their sight and are easily shed in order to run the race more effectively.</h2>        
                    <h2 class="quote">The proper motivation for Christian denial is essential. Motivations that lead to pride and self-righteousness are extremely perilous and easily ensnare those walking the path of sacrifice; they must be avoided at all costs.</h2>
                    <h2 class="quote">On the one hand, the disciple must be encouraged to practice self-sacrifice and sensual denial while also being protected from and taught to navigate these very real risks.</h2>
                    <h2 class="scripture">let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, - Heb 12:1b </h2>
                    <h2 class="quote">We must be driven by our love for Christ and a desire to run to, with, and for him. As our love for God grows, so does our desire to lay off more burdens that prevent us from running freely.</h2>
                </div>
        
                <button class="subaccordion">Way of Love</button>
                <div class="subpanel">
                    <h2 class="scripture">If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing. - 1 Cor 13:1-3</h2>
                    <h2 class="quote">Every aspect of the Christian life must be motivated by a love for Christ, yet this love is founded on Christ's love for us. God's love is evidenced by the fact that Jesus Christ came to die for our redemption.</h2>
                    <h2 class="quote">As a result, the gospel, or good news, is not only necessary for the beginning but also for the continuation of the Christian life. The Christian life will be completely fruitless unless it is founded on and permeated by the person and work of Jesus Christ. The discipler's job is fairly simple here: direct the disciple to Jesus Christ in everything.</h2>
                    <h2 class="quote">It is all too easy for believers who are progressing in their faith to become distracted from this reality. It is our responsibility to constantly redirect them to the means of grace that God employs to develop us in love.</h2>
